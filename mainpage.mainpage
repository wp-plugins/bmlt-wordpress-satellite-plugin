	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	
	This is the WordPress Plugin for the BMLT. It is designed to be extremely
	easy to install and use.
	
	\license This code is completely open and free. You may access it by <a href="http://magshare.org/welcome-to-magshare/bmlt-the-basic-meeting-list-toolbox/">visiting the BMLT Project Site</a>. It should never be sold.
	\version 1.5 (Read the changelog in the readme.txt file).
	
	<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
	You should <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bmlt-wordpress-satellite-plugin/">get this plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository</a>.
	From there, you can do an auto-install, or download the plugin to manually install.
	The plugin goes into the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.
	
	The plugin works by replacing inline HTML &lt;!--BMLT--&gt; with the BMLT.
	Just write a page or post, and add that HTML to it. At that point, you will
	get a BMLT instance.
