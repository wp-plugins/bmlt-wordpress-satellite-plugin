DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a class that is to be used by PHP coders, for writing custom satellite implementations
of the BMLT (Basic Meeting List Toolbox).

It is a class that handles the controller layer in the BMLT client/server system. This class will
deal with all HTTP interactions, and uses the XML interface of the BMLT root server to operate.

Read more about this class here: http://magshare.org/blog/the-satellite-driver-class/

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This class requires a root server version of at least 1.8.1, and 1.8.31 introduces some new details
that will add more capability. It *MAY* work with older root servers, but there are no guarantees as
to the level of functionality available.

 
INSTALLATION
------------

Simply include the bmlt_satellite_controller.class.php file, and instantiate an instance of
bmlt_satellite_controller.

See the unit_test.php and application_test.php files for usage examples.

This class is used in all of the current CMS satellite classes, via the BMLT Satellite Base Class:
