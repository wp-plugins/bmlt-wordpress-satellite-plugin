DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT) is a powerful, database-driven system for tracking NA meetings.
It is NOT an official product of NA ( http://na.org ). Rather, it is a project designed and implemented by
NA members, and meant to be used by official NA Service bodies.

This project is a CMS "base." It has a lot of functionality built into it, such as administration and various
renderers, but in a "CMS agnostic" fashion. The main class is designed to be extended (subclassed) for specific
CMS implementations.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The project requires a functioning BMLT root server ( http://magshare.org/blog/installing-the-root-server/ ).
It does not implement a root server, but connects to an existing one.
It requires PHP 5.0 or above.

This class uses the BMLT Satellite "Driver" Class, which is available on GitHub, here:

    https://bitbucket.org/bmlt/bmlt-satellite-driver.git
