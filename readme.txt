This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).

== Description ==

The <a href="http://magshare.org/bmlt">Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)</a> is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings.
The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin.
It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `the bmlt_plugin` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<!--BMLT-->` in the HTML view of a page. It will be replaced by the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. Search by map
2. A map search result
3. The administration screen
