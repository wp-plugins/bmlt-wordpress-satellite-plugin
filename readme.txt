Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 3.1.1
Stable tag: 2.1.4

This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).

== Description ==

The <a href="http://magshare.org/bmlt">Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)</a> is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings.
The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin.
It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.

<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Be extremely cautious in upgrading to the 2.0 version, as it represents a MAJOR departure from the 1.X versions!
The styling, especially, has been affected. If you have customized your installation, you'll probably need to redo it. We recommend that you create a custom "theme," by modifying one of the supplied themes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `the bmlt_plugin` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<!--BMLT-->` or `[[BMLT]]` in the HTML view of a page. It will be replaced by the plugin.
1. You can also use <a href="http://magshare.org/blog/welcome-to-magshare/bmlt-the-basic-meeting-list-toolbox/the-bmlt-in-depth/using-the-simple-table-output/">special shortcodes and HTML comments</a> (It's a slow page -have patience) to specify tables and blocks of predetermined search results.

== Changelog ==
2.1.4 -April 23, 2011
    Fixed a minor JS bug in the option submit. It did not result in errors, per se, but caused extra text to be transmitted.

2.1.3 -April 21, 2011
    Addressed some issues that could cause problems on some servers (a screwy intval() implementation).
    Made the save settings use POST, as the size of the transaction can be too large for GET, when you have a lot of settings.
    
2.1.2 -April 20, 2011
    Fixed some warnings that interfered with the operation of 2.1.1

2.1.1 -April 20, 2011
    Sequestered the mobile stuff into a fieldset in the admin.
    Added the ability to set the mobile "grace period," as well as specify a mobile offset from the server.
    Added a number of fixes and adjustments as we debugged the Joomla plugin.
    
2.1 -April 11, 2011
    Significant refactoring to make it easier to port the plugin to other CMSes.
    Added the ability to select distance units (Km or Mi). This will only affect the mobile handler (at the moment).
    Added the ability to project a language, via the original interactive search (You can select a different language from the server's default).
    
2.0.2 -March 3, 2011
    Fixed a critical problem that appeared in 2.0.1 because of a silly error on the coders' part.
    
2.0.1 -March 3, 2011
    Fixed a JavaScript issue that prevented the options from being displayed in Firefox.
    Added null parameters to some get_page() calls to prevent warnings.

2.0.0 -February 21, 2011
    Release.
    Added the GNYR theme to the release.
    
2.0.0RC1 -February 20, 2011
    Fixed a number of issues encountered during beta testing.
    
2.0.0B0 -February 14, 2011
    Major rewrite. You can now have multiple settings, which can include different servers.
    You can "theme" the displays.
    We no longer support non-JS browsers.
    Mobile content has been woven into the plugin. It now allows the page to be replaced with the fast mobile lookup, if that was requested.
    The administration has been drastically improved.
    This provides an infrastructure for many future improvements. The 2.0 release was aimed primarily at transitioning from the old system into the new.

		https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2892019&group_id=228122&atid=1073410
