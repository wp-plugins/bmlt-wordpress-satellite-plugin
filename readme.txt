Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 3.9.1
Stable tag: 3.0.23

This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).

== Description ==

The <a href="http://magshare.org/bmlt">Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)</a> is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings.
The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin.
It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.

<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Be extremely cautious in upgrading to the 3.0 version, as it represents a MAJOR departure from the 2.X versions!
The styling, especially, has been affected. If you have customized your installation, you'll probably need to redo it. We recommend that you create a custom "theme," by modifying one of the supplied themes.

Additionally, Version 3.0 of the plugin requires a root server version of 1.10.3 or greater. After May 19, 2013, it will require version 2.0 or greater (1.10.3 will no longer work, due to Google forcefully deprecating their maps API).
