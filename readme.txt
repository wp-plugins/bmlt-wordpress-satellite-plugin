Requires at least: 2.6

Stable tag: 2.1.17

This is a "satellite" plugin for the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).

== Description ==

The <a href="http://magshare.org/bmlt">Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT)</a> is a powerful client/server system for locating NA meetings.
The "root server" is a standalone Web site, but "satellite servers" are set up to point to the "root." This is a "satellite," set up as a WordPress plugin.
It is very easy to install and use. It has an administration panel that lets you choose a map center, designate the root, set up the map zoom, and whether or not older browsers are supported.

<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Be extremely cautious in upgrading to the 2.0 version, as it represents a MAJOR departure from the 1.X versions!
The styling, especially, has been affected. If you have customized your installation, you'll probably need to redo it. We recommend that you create a custom "theme," by modifying one of the supplied themes.

== Installation ==
