	\brief	This is an open-source JSON encoder that allows us to support
	older versions of PHP (before the <a href="http://us3.php.net/json_encode">json_encode()</a> function
	was implemented). It uses json_encode() if that function is available.
	
	This is from <a href="http://www.bin-co.com/php/scripts/array2json/">Bin-Co.com</a>.
	
	This crap needs to be included to be aboveboard and legal. You can still re-use the code, but
	you need to make sure that the comments below this are included:
